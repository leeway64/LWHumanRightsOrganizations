Uyghur Human Rights Project
============================

	The People's Republic of China (PRC) has committed crimes against humanity in East 
	Turkistan, known to the world as Xinjiang.

	The Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) "promotes the rights of the Uyghurs and other 
	Turkic Muslim peoples in East Turkistan" (https://uhrp.org/about/).
	Please consider donating to UHRP to help fight against the PRC's crimes in that area: https://uhrp.org/
